Theresa May was pictured giving Jean-Claude Juncker a hard look ahead of their crunch talks in Brussels.

While the president of the European Commission gazed jovially at the Prime Minister, she was seen fixing him with a glowering stare.

Many remarked on their uneasy body language before and after their meeting, which appeared to result in a stalemate.

The two have been seen to lock horns in public before, with the most recent example being their televised spat at the December summit in Brussels.

She was seen with the same wide-eyed stare, and appeared to accuse him of calling her "nebulous", as she angrily asked "what did you call me?"

Mrs May used the word  “robust” to describe that particular encounter, and again made reference to their robust relations after their meeting today.

The Prime Minister had aimed to seek legally binding changes to the backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement, but was immediately rebuffed by Mr Juncker.

The pair issued a joint statement following their “robust but constructive” meeting which made plain the Brexit impasse had not been resolved as they agreed to meet again before the end of February.

The statement said Mrs May had “raised various options for dealing with” concerns relating to the backstop but Mr Juncker “underlined that the EU27 will not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement”.

Mr Juncker did express “openness” to adding assurances to the Political Declaration on the future relationship between the UK and the EU but such a move would not be enough to win over Eurosceptic MPs who are adamant the backstop must be scrapped.
